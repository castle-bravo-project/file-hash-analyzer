A modern, web-based file hash analyzer that generates comprehensive cryptographic hash reports for any file type. Built with a clean, responsive interface and powerful client-side processing.

## Features

- **Multiple Hash Algorithms**: Supports MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Intuitive file upload with drag-and-drop support
- **Real-time Processing**: Client-side hash generation with no server dependency
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark Theme**: Modern dark UI with smooth animations
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copying of hash values
- **File Information**: Displays file type, size, and last modified date
- **No File Size Limits**: Process files of any size (limited only by browser memory)

## Demo

Simply open the HTML file in any modern web browser to start using the application immediately.

## Usage

1. **Upload a File**:
   - Click "Browse Files" to select a file
   - Or drag and drop a file into the upload area

2. **Generate Hashes**:
   - Click "Generate Hash Report" to calculate all hash values
   - Wait for processing to complete

3. **View Results**:
   - View all hash values in an organized grid layout
   - Copy any hash value to clipboard with the copy button
   - Review additional file information

## Supported Hash Algorithms

| Algorithm | Output Length | Common Use Cases |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| MD5       | 128-bit (32 hex chars) | Legacy systems, quick checksums |
| SHA-1     | 160-bit (40 hex chars) | Git commits, digital signatures |
| SHA-256   | 256-bit (64 hex chars) | Bitcoin, SSL certificates, secure applications |
| SHA-512   | 512-bit (128 hex chars) | High-security applications, password hashing |
