# Data Privacy Policy

**File Hash Analyzer**

*Last Updated: July 14, 2025*

## Overview

This Data Privacy Policy explains how the File Hash Analyzer application handles user data and protects user privacy. We are committed to maintaining the highest standards of data protection and user privacy.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect
**We collect NO personal data, user information, or file content.**

The File Hash Analyzer operates entirely within your browser and does not:
- Collect personal identification information
- Store user files or file content
- Transmit data to external servers
- Track user behavior or usage patterns
- Use cookies or local storage for data collection
- Require user registration or accounts

### What We Don't Collect
- Names, email addresses, or contact information
- IP addresses or device identifiers
- File contents or metadata
- Usage statistics or analytics
- Location data
- Browser fingerprinting data

## Data Processing

### Client-Side Processing
All file processing occurs entirely within your web browser:

- **File Upload**: Files are loaded into browser memory only
- **Hash Generation**: Cryptographic calculations performed locally
- **No Transmission**: No data leaves your device
- **Temporary Storage**: Files exist only in RAM during processing
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Memory is cleared when you close the browser tab

### Processing Location
- **Your Device**: All processing occurs on your local machine
- **No Cloud Processing**: No files are sent to external servers
- **No Third-Party Services**: No data shared with external services
- **Offline Capable**: Works without internet connection after initial load

## Data Storage

### Local Storage
- **No Persistent Storage**: Files are not saved to your device
- **Memory Only**: Files exist temporarily in browser memory
- **Session-Based**: Data cleared when tab is closed
- **No Browser Storage**: No use of localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies

### File Handling
- **Temporary Processing**: Files loaded into memory for hash calculation
- **Immediate Disposal**: File data discarded after processing
- **No Caching**: No temporary files created on your system
- **Secure Memory**: Browser handles memory cleanup automatically

## Data Security

### Security Measures
- **Client-Side Encryption**: All hash calculations performed locally
- **No Network Transmission**: Zero data transmission to external servers
- **Browser Security**: Relies on your browser's built-in security features
- **No Server Infrastructure**: No servers that could be compromised
- **HTTPS Delivery**: Application served over secure HTTPS connections

### Technical Safeguards
- **Sandboxed Execution**: Runs within browser security sandbox
- **No File System Access**: Cannot access other files on your device
- **Memory Isolation**: Isolated from other browser tabs and applications
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Browser manages memory deallocation

## Third-Party Services

### External Dependencies
The application uses the following external libraries via CDN:

- **Tailwind CSS**: For user interface styling
- **CryptoJS**: For cryptographic hash function implementations

### CDN Privacy
- **Static Assets Only**: Only JavaScript and CSS files are loaded
- **No Data Transmission**: No user data sent to CDN providers
- **Standard Web Requests**: Similar to loading any website resource
- **No Tracking**: CDN requests don't include user data

## User Rights

### Your Control
You have complete control over your data:

- **File Selection**: You choose which files to process
- **Processing Control**: You initiate all hash calculations
- **Data Removal**: Simply close the browser tab to clear all data
- **No Account Required**: No registration or login needed

### Data Portability
- **Copy Hash Values**: All generated hashes can be copied to clipboard
- **Export Capability**: Hash values can be saved by copying to external applications
- **No Vendor Lock-in**: Standard hash values work with any system

## Compliance

### Privacy Regulations
This application complies with major privacy regulations:

- **GDPR**: No personal data collection or processing
- **CCPA**: No sale or sharing of personal information
- **PIPEDA**: No personal information handling
- **Privacy by Design**: Built with privacy as a core principle

### Data Minimization
- **Zero Data Collection**: We don't collect what we don't need
- **Purpose Limitation**: Only processes files for hash generation
- **Retention Minimization**: No data retention beyond processing
- **Access Limitation**: No access to user data by developers

## Changes to This Policy

### Policy Updates
- **Version Control**: All changes are tracked and dated
- **User Notification**: Policy updates will be clearly marked
- **Effective Date**: Changes take effect immediately upon publication
- **Historical Versions**: Previous versions available upon request

### Notification Method
Since we don't collect contact information, policy changes will be communicated through:
- Updates to this document with clear change indicators
- Version history maintained in the application repository

## Technical Implementation

### Privacy-First Architecture
```
User Device (Your Computer)
├── Browser Memory (Temporary)
│   ├── File Data (During Processing)
│   ├── Hash Calculations (CryptoJS)
│   └── UI State (Session Only)
├── No Local Storage
├── No Network Transmission
└── No External Data Processing
```

### Data Flow
1. **File Selection**: User selects file from local device
2. **Memory Loading**: File loaded into browser RAM
3. **Hash Processing**: Cryptographic calculations performed locally
4. **Result Display**: Hash values shown in browser
5. **Memory Cleanup**: Data automatically cleared when tab closed

## Contact Information

### Questions or Concerns
If you have questions about this privacy policy:

- **Open Source**: Review the application source code
- **Transparency**: All functionality is visible in the client-side code
- **Community**: Engage through the project's public repository
- **Verification**: Inspect network traffic to confirm no data transmission

### Security Issues
If you discover security vulnerabilities:
- Report through the project's issue tracking system
- Provide detailed information about the potential issue
- Allow reasonable time for investigation and response

## Verification

### How to Verify Our Claims
You can verify our privacy practices by:

1. **Inspect Network Traffic**: Use browser developer tools to confirm no data transmission
2. **Review Source Code**: All code is visible in the HTML file
3. **Check Local Storage**: Verify no data is stored in browser storage
4. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Observe memory cleanup when closing the tab

### Independent Audit
- **Open Source**: Code is publicly available for review
- **Transparent Implementation**: No hidden functionality
- **Community Review**: Open to public security audits
- **Reproducible**: Results can be verified independently
